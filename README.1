HOMEWORK 1: Ngram Models 

Problems encounterd in our code: 

Model.py 
 
We have a feeling that our perpelexity calculations might not be accurate (lines 127 - 176). If the problem is with our code then it refers back to our calcualtions 
either in the perpelexity function or our probability function(lines ). But if not it might be the size of the coprus that is skewing the calcuations.

There is also another problem with the choose_successor function (lines 179 - 201) where the code will choose a successor 
however it does this at random and not based on a any probability calculations. We tried to fix this by using the 'weights' variable 
in the python method random.choices() and assigning the weight i.e. probability of being chosen at random as the the value of the 
corresponding bigram key in the n-gram dictionary (see lines 185 -193). However, this did not work and it returned an error 
saying the the length of the lists did not match. As we did not have anymore time to troubleshoot this, we decided to leave it out. 
But we are aware that the choose_successor function is not accurate without taking into account the probability of the choice. 

Generate.py 


We could not get this function to work. Conceptually we understood the problem however our code is not looping through and continuing the sentence. 
Instead it only choosed the immeadiate word after the start symbol. Also, as mentioned before, our choose function is not probability based but random 
and therefore if our code were to work it is likely to  produce some ugrammatical pairings/sentences.
