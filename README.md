HOMEWORK 1: Ngram Models
DUE at 23:59 on Sunday, May 18, 2025

Your goal in this assignment is to build a stochastic text generator based on an ngram model:

Build an ngram model for a corpus.
Implement add-k smoothing on your model, and use it to calculate the perplexity of some text.
Use your model in reverse, to generate random text based on the transition probabilities in the models.
Read the instructions carefully. Many of the necessary concepts and skills are covered in the forthcoming reading and practica (up to and including Practicum 6).

Projects will be graded on function (correct results, design according to the specification) as well as form (organization and appropriateness of the code, documentation). Test the parts of your program to ensure that they work as intended.



- here we can add later the division of labour and maybe also a sort of checklist of what we need to do by steps to complete the assignment


#TODO 
- create your own branch for coding under the main thingy
